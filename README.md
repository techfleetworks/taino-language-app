# Learn Taino
Learn Taino is a language-learning app that helps Taino descendants and culture enthusiasts learn the Taino language and culture.

## Background
The Taíno, the Indigenous people of the Caribbean and parts of the southern U.S., were the first Native Americans to meet Europeans in 1492. Though long thought extinct after colonization, they survived - many Caribbean people today have Taíno ancestry, and efforts are ongoing to preserve their culture and language.
